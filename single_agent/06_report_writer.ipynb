    "        ![Intrusion Attempts Forecast](./figures/Intrusion_Attempts_forecast_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Trend Analysis: The data reveals a clear upward trend in intrusion attempts over time, indicating a steady increase in malicious activities targeting the system.\n",
    "        - Seasonality: There is evidence of recurring patterns, with peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals. This cyclical behavior suggests periodic threats or exploitation of recurring vulnerabilities.\n",
    "        - Forecast Accuracy: The forecasted values (pink line) closely align with the actual values (blue line), demonstrating the reliability of the forecasting model used. The forecast projects a continued rise in intrusion attempts.\n",
    "    ## Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Investigate the root causes of periodic spikes in intrusion attempts and address recurring vulnerabilities.\n",
    "        2. Enhance perimeter defenses, such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to mitigate the projected increase in threats.\n",
    "        3. Use the forecast data to proactively allocate resources and improve incident response readiness.\n",

    "        ![Intrusion Attempts Forecast](./figures/Incident_Detection_Rate_anomalies_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Anomalies Identified: The model detected multiple anomalies (red circles), representing instances where the detection rate significantly deviated from expected behavior. These could indicate system misconfigurations, unusual attack patterns, or delayed responses.\n",
    "        - Overall Stability: The detection rate generally remains within the expected range (purple shaded region), indicating consistent performance of the detection mechanisms. However, periodic spikes and dips highlight areas for further investigation.\n",
    "        - Spike Analysis: Spikes in detection rates may correlate with periods of heightened activity or improved detection capabilities, while dips could reflect potential monitoring gaps or delayed responses.\n",
    "    ## Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Investigate the root causes of anomalies to determine if they were triggered by system issues, attacker behavior, or external factors.\n",
    "        2. Strengthen detection mechanisms during anticipated periods of increased activity, as identified in the intrusion attempts forecast.\n",
    "        3. Conduct regular audits and testing of detection systems to ensure consistent and reliable performance.\n",
    "        4. Optimize thresholds and refine detection logic to minimize false positives and negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # High-Level Insights:\n",
    "        1. Correlated Trends: The upward trend in intrusion attempts and the relatively stable detection rate suggest that the organization is successfully detecting threats despite the increasing attack volume.\n",
    "        2. Proactive Planning: The forecasted rise in intrusion attempts highlights the importance of scaling up security measures and optimizing response processes to handle the growing threat landscape.\n",
    "        3. Anomaly Management: Addressing the identified anomalies in the detection rate provides an opportunity to improve detection accuracy and maintain system resilience.\"\"\",\n",
